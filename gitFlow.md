# Gitflow Workflow

Gitflow Workflow defines a strict branching model designed for managing the releases. This is the robust framework used for managing large projects.This is used for maintaining the sheduled releases. It assigns specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact.In addition to feature branches, it uses individual branches for preparing, maintaining, and recording releases.

Gitflow is really an abstract class of Git Workflow. It help us to create organised branches and how they should merge with eachother. Gitflow can be implemented in many operating Systems.
