## &#x1F538; Static Methods in Python

Static Methods are similar to the class methods in python. The difference detween staic methods and class methods is that staic methods bound to a class rather object of a class.So, staic methods can be called without object of a class.

## &#x1F538; Objects in Python

Creating a class means creating a new type of object, allowing new instance of that type to be made. Object can have multiple names and can be bound to the same class.

## &#x1F538; Exceptions in Python

Errors detected during the execution are called as exceptions. They can be not severe errors though. There are different kinds of exceptions in python. The last line of error message is the exception which you have occured. Some of the exceptions which can occur are 'Zero Division Error', 'NameError', 'TypeError','Arthemetic Error', etc.

Here is the link for [Built in exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#bltin-exceptions) documentation.
