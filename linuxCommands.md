# Linux Text Editing

 When working with text editors, you pretty much choose between Vi or Nano.
 
1. Working in 'vi' editor:
   - Vi will automatically open in Command mode. On the bottom you will see some info such as the name of the document & info on whether it is a new file or an existing one. Let's look at an existing file. 
   - There are three modes to Vi: Command mode, Text mode & Ex Mode. 
   - Command Mode: If you tried to start typing in command mode you wouldn't be able to. 
   - Text/ Insert Mode: You need to hit the “I” in order to get into text mode.
   - Ex mode: You can then get back to command mode by the ESC key. Typng “:” will put you into Ex mode.
   - In order to quit Vi, you have to hit the Esc key and then enter in “:” along with “q” for quit.

2. Working with 'nano' editor: Nano has a pseudo-graphical layout that makes it a little easier to jump right into. 
   - There will be list of commands to perform which are displayed at the bottom of the nano editor.
